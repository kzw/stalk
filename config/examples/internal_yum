# the following time specified the amount time stalk waits when it detects write operations before it starts to do its rsync/trigger
# stuff.  So if you specify 30 sec, you start to do a sequence of write operations, so long no there is no 30 s time gaps between
# these operations, stalk will do nothing.  When you finish the write operations, it will do work only after 30 second of quiet time.
# 'root' directory is where your files persist after you umount
# log location is in addition to syslog
timeout: 10
root: /home/win/.internal_yum
